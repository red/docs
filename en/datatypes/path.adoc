= Path! datatype

== Abstract

The `path!` datatype represents a series of values delimited by slashes (`/`). `Path!` is a type of `block!` that is limited in the types of values that it can contain. `Word!`, `integer!`, `get-word!`, and `paren!` values are supported. 

`Path!` is a member of the following typesets: `any-block!`, `any-path!`, `series!`

== Creation

Path values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime by using a `make` constructor or `to` conversion.

```red
>> 'foo/bar/baz 
== foo/bar/baz
```

```red
>> make path! [foo bar baz]
== foo/bar/baz
```

You can create an empty path of a given size by supplying an integer value as an argument to `make`:

```red
>> make path! 10
== 
```

`To` conversion:

```red
>> to path! "foo bar baz"
== foo/bar/baz
```

[NOTE, caption=Caution]

It is possible to create `path!` values programmatically that do not conform to the lexical rules of a literal path. 

```red
>> mold to path! [a #(b: 2) c 1.2 /z]
== "a/#(^/    b: 2^/)/c/1.2//z"

>> load mold to path! [a #(b: 2) c 1.2 /z]
*** Syntax Error: invalid path! at "a/#(    b: 2)/c/1.2//z"
*** Where: do
*** Stack: load  
```

== Literal syntax

BNF:

```
<path-literal> ::= <path-head>/<selector>
<path-head>    ::= <word-literal> | <path-literal>
<selector> ::= <integer> | <word-literal> | :<word-literal> | <paren>
```

Parse:

```
path: [word! some selector]
selector: [#"/" [integer! | word! | get-word! | paren!]]
```

Path-head datatypes: link:word.adoc[word!], `path!`

Selector datatypes: link:integer.adoc[integer!], link:word.adoc[word!], link:get-word.adoc[get-word!], link:paren.adoc[paren!]

== Evaluation Steps

Paths lead to a nested value, or to a more specific behavior in a function call. They must start with a word, and the value that the word refers to determines how the path will be evaluated. 

* If the value is a function, the following expressions in the path must be `word!` values. These words are treated as refinements in the function call. 

```red
>> append/only [42][foo]
== [42 [foo]]
```

An error will be raised if no corresponding refinement exists in the function:

```red
>> append/xyz [42][foo]
*** Script Error: append has no refinement called xyz
*** Where: append
*** Stack: 
```

[NOTE]
Paths are an active type and will evaluate stored functions. `Op!` values are not currently evaluated.

```red
>> f: does [42]
== func [][42]

>> insert b: [] :f
== []

>> b/1
== 42
```

* If the value is not a function, the following rules apply:

** If the next expression in the path is a word, it is used to `select` from the path-head value. The path-head value must be of a type that supports `select` (e.g. a `block!`, `map!`, or `object!`).

```red
>> blk: [foo bar baz]
== [foo bar baz]

>> blk/bar
== baz
```

If the selection does not exist in the path-head value, `select` will return `none`:

```red
>> blk/sheboygan
== none
```

* Word! expressions in paths, after the first, are not evaluated. If you want to evaluate them, use `get-word!` or `paren!` in the path.

```red
>> selector: 'bar
== bar

>> my-block: [foo bar baz]
== [foo bar baz]

>> my-block/:selector
== baz
```

```red
>> my-block/('bar) 
== baz
```

* If the next expression in the path is an integer, it is used to `pick` from the path-head value. The path-head value must be of a type that supports `pick` (e.g. a `series!`, `tuple!`, or `date!`).

```red
>> blk: [foo bar baz qux]
== [foo bar baz qux]

>> blk/3  ; pick from the third index of blk
== baz
```

If the integer falls outside the bounds of the path-head value, `pick` returns `none`:

```red
>> length? blk
== 4

>> blk/7
== none

>> blk/-1
== none
```

== Testing values

Use `path?` to check if a value is of the `path!` datatype.

```red
>> path? 'foo/bar
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? 'foo/bar
== path!
```

== Predefined words

=== Functions

`any-block?`, `any-path?`, `path?`, `series?`, `to-path`
