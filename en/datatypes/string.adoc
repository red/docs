= String! datatype

== Abstract

A `string!` value is a sequence of Unicode code points, or link:char.adoc[char!] values.

`String!` is a member of the following typesets: `any-string!`, `default!`, `series!`

== Creation

String values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime by using a `make` constructor or `to` conversion.

```red
>> s: make string! 100
== ""
```

```red
>> to string! 'foo
== "foo"

>> to string! [bar]
== "bar"

>> to string! 42
== "42"
```

The `native!` values `form` and `mold` can also be used to convert a value to a user-friendly string or a source format string, respectively.

```red
>> form 'foo
== "foo"
```

```red
>> mold 'bar
== "bar"
```

[NOTE, caption=Note]

Attempting to convert `none` by `to` conversion raises an error.

== Literal syntax

Single-line string:

Zero or more characters enclosed in quotation marks.

`"foo"`

Multi-line string:

Zero or more characters enclosed in opening and closing braces.

`{foo}` 

A single-line string cannot contain unescaped new-line characters.

```red
>> cr
== #"^M"

>> lf
== #"^/"

>> crlf
== "^M^/"
```

A multi-line string can contain new-line characters, quotation marks, and paired braces. Unpaired braces must be escaped by preceding the character with `^`, e.g. `{foo^{}`.

== Comparisons

All comparators can be applied on `string!`: `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, &lt;=, =?`. In addition, `min`, and `max` are also supported.


== Testing values

Use `string?` to check if a value is of the `string!` datatype.

```red
>> string? "foo"
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? "foo"
== string!
```
