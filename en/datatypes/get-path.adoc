= Get-path! datatype
:toc:
:numbered:


== Abstract

A `get-path!` value returns the value of a `path!`, unevaluated.

`Get-path!` is a member of the following typesets: `any-block!`, `any-path!`, `series!`

== Creation

Get-path! values can be created at runtime by using a `make` constructor or `to` conversion.

```red
>> make get-path! [foo bar baz]
== :foo/bar/baz
```

You can create an empty get-path of a given size by supplying an integer value as an argument to `make`:

```red
>> make get-path! 10
== :
```

`To` conversion:

```red
>> to get-path! "foo bar baz"
== :foo/bar/baz
```

== Literal syntax

BNF:

```
<get-path-literal>  ::= :<path-literal>

<path-literal> ::= <path-head>/<selector>
<path-head>    ::= <word-literal> | <path-literal>
<selector> ::= <integer> | <word-literal> | :<word-literal> | <paren>
```

Parse:

```
get-path: [get-word! some selector]
selector: [#"/" [integer! | word! | get-word! | paren!]]
```

Selector datatypes: link:integer.adoc[integer!], link:word.adoc[word!], link:get-word.adoc[get-word!], link:paren.adoc[paren!]


== Evaluation Steps

A get-path! value follows the same evaluation rules as `path!` until the selector is reached, at which point the value referred to by the selector is returned without being evaluated.

== Testing values

Use `get-path?` to check if a value is of the `get-path!` datatype.

```red
>> get-path? first [:foo/bar]
== true

>> get-path? quote :foo/bar
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? first [:foo/bar]
== get-path!

>> type? quote :foo/bar
== get-path!
```
