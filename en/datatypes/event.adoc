== Abstract

`Event!` values are object-like values that represent external activity.

`Event!` is a member of the following typesets: `default!`, `external!`

== Creation

Event values cannot be created with `make` or `to`, and they have no literal form. They are sourced from the operating system and are effectively read-only values.

See link:https://doc.red-lang.org/en/view.html#_events[View documentation] for more information on events.

== Testing values

Use `event?` to check if a value is of the `event!` datatype.
