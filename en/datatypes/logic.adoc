== Abstract

The `logic!` datatype represents the boolean values `true` and `false`.

`Logic!` is a member of the following typesets: `immediate!`

== Creation

Logic! values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime using a `make` constructor, or a `to` conversion.


`to logic!` converts to `true` for any value except for `false` and `none`.

```red
>> to logic! 'hi
== true

>> to logic! 123
== true

>> to logic! none
== false

>> to logic! false
== false
```


== Literal syntax

The predefined words `true` and `false`, or the serialized syntax:
```red
#[true]

#[false]
```

== Testing values

Use `logic?` to check if a value is of the `logic!` datatype.

```red
>> logic? on
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? false
== logic!
```


== Pre-defined words

`true`, `yes`, `on`

`false`, `no`, `off`
