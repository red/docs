= Ref! datatype

:numbered:

== Abstract

`ref!` values denote named references, such as social media handles or identifiers with an implied domain name.

`ref!` datatype belongs to `any-string!` typeset while being conceptually close to an `issue!` datatype, differing from it in implementation (string-like vs. symbol-like) and offered set of trade-offs.

== Creation

`ref!` values can be created using literal syntax at load-time or constructed at run-time using either a `make` constructor or a `to` conversion.

=== Literal syntax

`ref!` values support only one unique literal form described below.

*Syntax*

----
<ref> format : @<name>

<name> : optional name of a referent
----

* `<name>` is zero or more characters other than `# $ ' , = > @ \ ^`;
* literal form is terminated by one of the `" ( ) ; < [ ] { }` or blank (space, tab, `CR`, `LF`) characters.

*Examples*

----
@
@red_lang
@dockimbel
@§2.1
----

=== Runtime construction

Rules of `ref!` construction using `make` are as follows:

* `float!` and `integer!` specs denote the number of bytes to pre-allocate (`float!` is truncated);
* construction from any other datatype is equivalent to `to` <<Conversion, conversion>>.

*Examples*

----
make ref! 9.2
== @

make ref! 14
== @

make ref! <ref>
== @ref

make ref! [red (_lang)]
== @red_lang

make ref! #{76616C7565}
== @value

make ref! none
** cannot make error

make ref! #datatype
== @datatype
----

== Conversion

`ref!` supports a subset of datatype conversions valid for `any-string!` typeset.
 In particular, when converting a given value to `ref!`, the transformations described below are applied, followed by the prepending of a `@` character.

.Datatypes that can be converted to `ref!`.
[options="header" cols="1,5"]
|===
| Datatype | Description

| `any-string!`
| Content is copied verbatim.

| `any-list!`
| `form` ed representations of contained values are catenated together, outer delimiters are discarded.

| `binary!`
| Converted to string form if it contains a valid UTF-8 encoding.

| `none!`
| Forbidden.

| Other
| Equivalent to `form`.

|===

*Examples*

----
to-ref [f /o #o]
== @foo

to-ref #{626172}
== @bar

to-ref <qux>
== @qux

to-ref none
** cannot make error
----

Being a part of `any-string!` typeset, `ref!` values support many target types for conversion; their list and descriptions are given in the table below.

.Datatypes that can be converted from `ref!`.
[options="header" cols="3,9"]
|===
| Datatype | Description

| `any-list!`
| Equivalent to enclosing `ref!` value in a container of a given datatype.

| `any-string!`
| Content is copied verbatim.

| `number!`, `money!`, `time!`, `tuple!`
| In general equivalent to conversion to `load` if `ref!` represents a well-formed literal of a given datatype.

More details on supported literal formats can be found in the respective documentation. 

| `none!`, `unset!`
| Value of a given datatype is returned (singleton).

| `logic!`
| Logical `true` is returned, following language semantics.

| `binary!`
| UTF-8 encoded binary representation is returned as a result.

| `char!`
| First character, if present, is extracted.

| Other
| Forbidden.

|===

*Examples*

----
to-paren @ABC
== (@ABC)

to-tag @tag
== <tag>

to-float @+88.7
== 88.7

to-tuple @1.3.3.7
== 1.3.3.7

to-none @whatever
== none

to-logic @this-ref-is-false
== true

to-binary @matrix
== #{6D6174726978}

to-char @
** cannot make error

to-char @.:
== #"."
----

== Operations

`ref!` supports all series actions (except for `put`, `sort` and `trim`) and all types of comparison in addition to `min` and `max`.

NOTE: `form` applied to `ref!` value discards a `@` character, while `mold` preserves it.

*Examples*

----
reverse @alucard
== @dracula

find @haystack "needle"
== none

find @haystack 'stack
== @stack

skip @stackoverflow 5
== @overflow

@this = "this"
== true

@this = @that
== false

@that == @that
== true

min @A @Z
== @A

form @content
== "content"

mold/part @catastrophy 4
== "@cat"
----

== Other functions

Functions related to `ref!` datatype but not described in the previous sections are listed below:

* `ref?` predicate that returns `true` if a given value has a `ref!` datatype;
* changing case: `uppercase` and `lowercase`;
* conversion of URL-style percent-encoded content: `dehex`.
