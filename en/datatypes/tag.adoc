== Abstract

`Tag!` values represent markup language tags and elements.

`Tag!` is a member of the following typesets: `any-string!`, `series!`

== Creation

Tag values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime by using a `make` constructor or `to` conversion.

```red
>> make tag! "foo"
== <foo>
```

```red
>> to tag! 'bar
== <bar>
```

== Literal syntax

One or more characters enclosed by a open angle bracket `<` and closing angle bracket `>`.

The first position after the opening angle bracket cannot contain `<`, `>`, `=`, or literal whitespace.

```red
>> <<foo>
*** Script Error: < operator is missing an argument
*** Where: catch
*** Stack:  

>> <>foo>
*** Script Error: <> operator is missing an argument
*** Where: catch
*** Stack:  

>> <=foo>
*** Syntax Error: invalid value at "<=foo>"
*** Where: do
*** Stack: load 

>> < foo>
*** Script Error: < operator is missing an argument
*** Where: catch
*** Stack: 
```

`<` is allowed after the first position.

```red
>> type? <f<oo>
== tag!
```

[NOTE, caption=Note]

It is possible to create `tag!` values using `make` that are not affected by current lexer limitations. 

```red
>> make tag! " foo"
== < foo>

>> make tag! "<foo"
== <<foo>

>> make tag! ">foo"
== <>foo>

>> make tag! "=foo"
== <=foo>

>> make tag! " foo"
== < foo>
```

== Comparisons

All comparators can be applied on `tag!`: `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, &lt;=, =?`. In addition, `min`, and `max` are also supported.

== Testing values

Use `tag?` to check if a value is of the `tag!` datatype.

```red
>> tag? <foo>
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? <foo>
== tag!
```
