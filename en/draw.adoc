== Abstract 

Draw is a dialect (DSL) of Red language that provides a simple declarative way to specify 2D drawing operations. Such operations are expressed as lists of ordered commands (using blocks of values), which can be freely constructed and changed at run-time.

Draw blocks can be rendered directly on top of an image using the `draw` function, or inside a View face using the `draw` facet (see link:View.html[View documentation]).

== Draw commands

Commands can either be drawing instructions or settings for the drawing instructions. When a mode is set, it will affect all subsequent operations in the current Draw session (or until changed).

Most Draw commands require coordinates to be specified. The 2D coordinate system used is:

* x axis: increasing from left to right of the display.
* y axis: increasing from top to bottom of the display.

Some drawing commands require lengths to be specified. The length required is number of pixels.

=== Line 

*Syntax*

----
line <point> <point> ...

<point> : coordinates of a point (pair!).
----
*Description*

Draws a line between two points. If more points are specified, additional lines are drawn, connecting each point in the provided order.

=== Triangle 

*Syntax*
----
triangle <point> <point> <point>

<point> : coordinates of a vertex of the triangle (pair!).
----
NOTE: A vertex is the point at which two lines meet. They are points where edges join.

*Description*

Draws a triangle with edges between the supplied vertices.

=== Box 

*Syntax*
----
box <top-left> <bottom-right>
box <top-left> <bottom-right> <corner>

<top-left>     : coordinates of the top-left of the box (pair!).
<bottom-right> : coordinates of the bottom-right of the box (pair!).
<corner>       : (optional) radius of the arc used to draw a round corner (integer!).
----
*Description*

Draws a box using the top-left (first argument) and bottom-right (second argument) vertices. An optional radius can be provided for making round corners.

=== Polygon 

*Syntax*
----
polygon <point> <point> ...

<point> : coordinates of a vertex (pair!).
----
*Description*

Draws a polygon using the provided vertices. The last point does not need to be the starting point, an extra line will be drawn anyway to close the polygon. Minimal number of points to be provided is 3.

=== Circle
 
*Syntax*
----
circle <center> <radius>
circle <center> <radius-x> <radius-y>

<center>   : coordinates of the circle's center (pair!).

<radius-x> : (ellipse mode) radius of the circle along X axis (integer! float!).
<radius-y> : (ellipse mode) radius of the circle along Y axis (integer! float!).
----
*Description*

Draws a circle from the provided center and radius values. The circle can be distorted to form an ellipse by adding an optional integer indicating the radius along Y axis (the other radius argument then becomes the radius along X).

=== Ellipse 

*Syntax*
----
ellipse <top-left> <size>

<top-left> : coordinates of the ellipse's bounding box top-left point (pair!).
<size>     : size of the bounding box (pair!).
----
*Description*

Draws an ellipse from the specified bounding box. The `size` argument represents the X and Y diameters of the ellipse.

NOTE: `ellipse` provide a more compact and box-oriented way to specify a circle/ellipse compared to `circle` command.

=== Arc 

*Syntax*
----
arc <center> <radius> <begin> <sweep>
arc <center> <radius> <begin> <sweep> closed

<center> : coordinates of the circle's center (pair!).
<radius> : radius of the circle (pair!).
<begin>  : starting angle in degrees (integer!).
<sweep>  : angle between the starting and ending points of the arc in degrees (integer!).

* shapes are automatically closed (no need to draw the last stroke back to start position).
* the generated shapes can be fed to `fill-pen` for simple or sophisticated filling.

NOTE: All drawing commands are using absolute coordinates by default, using the lit-word version of the command switches the command to relative coordinates.

== Default values 

When a new Draw session starts, the following default values are used:

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
|Property | Value

|background | `white`
|pen color |  `black`
|filling|    `off`
|anti-alias|	 `on`
|font|	 `none`
|line width|	 `1`
|line join|	 `miter`
|line cap| `flat`
|===

== Sub blocks 

Inside Draw code, commands can be arbitrarily grouped using blocks. Semantics remain unchanged, this is currently just a syntactic sugar allowing easier group manipulations of commands (notably group extraction/insertion/removal). Empty blocks are accepted.

== Source position 

Set-words can be used in the Draw code *in-between* commands to record the current position in Draw block and be able to easily access it later.

NOTE: If the Draw block length preceeding a set-word is changed, the recorded position will not be updated.

== Draw function 

It is possible to render a Draw block directly to an image using the `draw` function.

*Syntax*
----
draw <size> <spec>
draw <image> <spec>

<size>  : size of a new image (pair!).
<image> : image to use as canvas (image!).
<spec>  : block of Draw commands (block!).
----
*Description*

Renders the provided Draw commands to an existing or a new image. The image value is returned by the function.

== Graphics source code 

The graphics in this documentation are generated using Red and Draw dialect, here is the source code (you can copy/paste it in a Red console to try/play/improve it):
