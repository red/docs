== Overview

Rich-Text is text that supports formatting. Different graphic styles can be applied to text or to segments of text.

The Rich-Text API has three different levels, from simplest to most optimized:

* Using RTD (from VID, or when manually constructing the face).
* A low-level rich styling dialect for one text string (for fast performance).
* Multiple rich text paragraphs in a single face (for complex layouts).

== High-level Rich-Text Dialect (RTD)

*Grammar* 

```red
nested: [ahead block! into rtd]
color:  [
    s: tuple!	(v: s/1)							;-- color as R.G.B tuple
	| issue!	(v: hex-to-rgb s/1)					;-- color as #rgb or #rrggbb hex value
	| word! 	if (tuple? attempt [v: get s/1])
]
f-args: [
	ahead block! into [integer! string! | string! integer!]
	| integer!
	| string!
]
style!: make typeset! [word! tag! tuple! path!]
style: [ahead style! [
	  ['b | 'bold      | <b>] (push 'b)	[nested | rtd [/b | /bold 	   | </b>]] (pop 'b)
	| ['i | 'italic    | <i>] (push 'i)	[nested | rtd [/i | /italic	   | </i>]] (pop 'i)
	| ['u | 'underline | <u>] (push 'u)	[nested | rtd [/u | /underline | </u>]] (pop 'u)
	| ['s | 'strike    | <s>] (push 's)	[nested | rtd [/s | /strike	   | </s>]] (pop 's)
	| ['f | 'font      | <font>]
	    s: f-args (push either block? s/1 [head insert copy s/1 'f][reduce ['f s/1]]) 
		[nested | rtd [/f | /font | </font>]]
		(pop 'f)
	| ['bg | <bg>] color (push reduce ['bg v]) [nested | rtd [/bg | </bg>]] (pop 'bg)
	| color (push-color v) opt [nested (pop-color)]
	| ahead path!
	  into [
		(col: 0 insert/only mark tail stack) some [					;@@ implement any-single
			(v: none)
			s: ['b | 'i | 'u | 's | word! if (tuple? attempt [v: get s/1])]
			(either v [col: col + 1 push-color v][push s/1])
		](insert cols col)
	  ]
    nested (pop-all take mark)
]]
rtd: [some [pos: style | s: [string! | char!] (append text s/1 s-idx: tail-idx?)]]
```

[NOTE]
====
The path syntax allows to combine several styles together to be applied on the block following the path.
Mixed usage of delimiters and blocks for different styles is allowed.
====

*Usage*

RTD input is processed by a specific `rtd-layout` function that will return a single-box rich-text face, where the RTD code will be compiled to a single text string (stored in /text facet) and a low-level styling description (stored in /data facet). 

The full specification of the function is:

```red
rtd-layout func [
		"Returns a rich-text face from a RTD source code"
		spec [block!]	"RTD source code"
		/only			"Returns only [text data] facets"
		/with			"Populate an existing face object"
			face [object!] "Face object to populate"
		return: [object! block!]
]
```

Example:

```red
rt: rtd-layout [<i> <b> "Hello" </b> <font> 24 red " Red " </font> blue "World!" </i>]

view [rich-text with [text: rt/text data: rt/data]]
```

RTD may be directly provided in VID for the rich-text `data` facet.

Examples:

```red
view compose [rich-text 200x100 data [i b "Hello" /b font 24 red " Red " /font blue "World!" /i]]

view compose [rich-text 200x100 data [i [b ["Hello"] red font 24 [" Red "] blue "World!"]]]

view compose [rich-text 200x100 data [i/b/u/red ["Hello" font 32 " Red " /font blue "World!"]]]

view compose [rich-text 200x100 data [i/blue ["Hello " b/u/red [font [32 "Arial"] "Red " /font] "World!"]]]
```

== Low-level Styling Dialect

This dialect describes a list of styles to be applied on the string referred by /text facet in a rich-text face. The purpose of this dialect is to provide a solution for dynamic changes and info querying that performs as fast as possible. This also maps well with the underlying hardware-accelerated APIs (it relies on Direct2D on Windows).

*Usage*

The dialect grammar is a simple list of text segments (defined using a starting position and a length combined in a pair! value) followed by a list of styles. So, the typical structure is:

```red
[
    <range1> style1 style2 ...        ;-- range1: start1 x length1
    <range2> style1 style2 ...        ;-- range2: start2 x length2
    ...
]
```

Styles can overlap, and later styles have higher priority (cascading styles).

The following styles are supported:

```red
[
      tuple!                              ;-- text color
    | backdrop tuple!                     ;-- background color
    | bold                                ;-- bold font
    | italic
    | underline tuple! (color)  lit-word! ('dash, 'double, 'triple) ;@@ color and type are not supported yet
    | strike tuple! (color) lit-word! ('wave, 'double)              ;@@ color and type are not supported yet
    | border tuple! (color) lit-word! ('dash, 'wave)                ;@@ not implemented
    | integer!                            ;-- new font size
    | string!                             ;-- new font name
]
```
[NOTE]
====
Text's color should not follow immediately after `strike` or `underline`. Color and type for `strike` and `underline` will modify their line styles, not text. As they are not yet implemented, specifying color (or type) after these keywords will have no effect.

== Rich text face type

A new native rich-text face type supports rich text features with underlying hardware-acceleration. The face has two modes for displaying rich text.

=== Single-box mode

The whole face area is used for displaying the rich text, starting at upper left corner, using the following specific facets:

* /data (block!): a block of low-level styling dialect instructions to be applied on text facet.
* /text (string!): a text string to be displayed using the /data facet styles description.

Draw facet can still be used and it will be rendered on top of the rich text display.

Examples:

```red
view [
    rich-text with [
        text: "Hello Red World!" 
        data: [1x17 0.0.255 italic 7x3 255.0.0 bold 24 underline]
    ]
]
view [
    rich-text "Hello Red World!" 
    with [data: [1x17 0.0.255 italic 7x3 255.0.0 bold 24 underline]]
]
```

=== Multi-box mode

In this mode, an arbitrary number of rich text areas can be displayed inside the same rich-text face. In order to achieve that, each rich text area is specified using the text keyword in Draw dialect.

Specific facets:

* /draw (block!): a block of text instructions, eventually mixed with regular Draw instructions.
* /text (none!): this facet must be set to none in order to enable this mode.

*Draw extension*

```
text <pos> <text>

<pos>  : a pair! value indicating the upper left corner of the text-box.
<text> : a string, or a rich-text face object with a rich-text description in single-box
```

Example:

```red
view compose/deep [
    rich-text 200x200 draw [
        text 10x10 (rt1: rtd-layout ["Some^/" b "text^/" /b "here"] rt1/size: 50x80 rt1)
        text 100x90 (rt2: rtd-layout [red "Other^/" b "text^/" /b "there"] rt1/size: 50x80 rt2)
        pen gold box 90x80 160x180
    ]
]
```

== Info querying functions

The following functions are provided to query information about the content of a rich-text face. These functions can be used to easily implement:

* cursor navigation
* hit testing

From the default context `system/words`:

```red
caret-to-offset: function [
    "Given a text position, returns the corresponding coordinate relative to the top-left of the layout box"
    face    [object!]
    pos     [integer!]
    return: [pair!]
]

offset-to-caret: function [
    "Given a coordinate, returns the corresponding text position"
    face    [object!]
    pt      [pair!]
    return: [integer!]
]
    
size-text: function [
    "Returns the area size of the text in a face" 
    face [object!]
    /with                   ;-- unused for rich-text
        text [string!]
    return: [pair! none!]
]
```

From the rich-text context:

```red
line-height?: function [
    "Given a text position, returns the corresponding line's height"
    face    [object!]
    pos     [integer!]
    return: [integer!]
]

line-count?: function [
    "number of lines (> 1 if line wrapped)"
    face    [object!]
    return: [integer!]
]
```

Examples:

```red
view [
	rich-text data [font 16 "Select some text with your mouse" /font] 
	on-down [
		bkg: reduce [ ; Background for selected text
			as-pair caret: offset-to-caret face event/offset 0 
			'backdrop sky
		] 
		either 2 = length? face/data [ ; On first selection
			pos: tail face/data 
			append face/data bkg
		][ ; Changing starting pos on subsequent selections
			change pos bkg/1
		]
	] all-over 
	on-over [
		if event/down? [ ; On dragging change only length
			pos/1/2: (offset-to-caret face event/offset) - caret
		]
	]
]
```

```red
view compose/deep [
    rich-text draw [
        text 10x10 (rt: rtd-layout [i/blue ["Hello " red/b [font 24 "Red " /font] "World!"]]) 
        line-width 5 pen gold 
        line ; Let's draw line under words using a pair of above helper functions
			(as-pair 10 h: 10 + rich-text/line-height? rt 1) ; Starting-point y -> 10 + line-height
			(as-pair 10 + pick size-text rt 1 h) ; End-point x -> 10 + length-of-text-size 
    ]
]
```
