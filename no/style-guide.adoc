== Introduction 

Red is a homoiconic language where code is represented as data. A consequence of that feature is that the language is almost totally free-form, in order to cope with all possible ways to format data, as well as being flexible enough for DSL-specific formatting needs. The following content is _just one of many, many ways_ to format Red code.

This document describes the _official coding style used in the Red source code_, so respecting this coding style is a prerequisite of every pull request submitted to `red/red` Github repository.

As Red/System is a dialect of Red, it shares the same syntax and coding style rules. Specific Red/System rules are marked as such.

The objectives of the following rules are to maximise readability, including keeping an optimum number of lines of code visible on-screen while minimizing the need for comments.

== Line of code length 

There is no strictly-defined maximum number of columns for a single line of code, as it can vary according to the type of the font used (size, proportional vs fixed-width) or highlighting effects. It should be possible to read a full line of code (excluding comments) in an editor occupying at maximum, half of a 1080p monitor width. On the displays we use for Red codebase coding, it is about 100 columns. In the description below, _excessive size_ or _too long_ expressions will refer to line of code sizes which do not fit the aforementioned criteria.

== Indentation 

Red codebase uses tabulations with size of *4* columns to indent the source code. This gives a good trade-off between too small values (like 2 columns) and too big ones (like 8 columns). Using tabs also means that you can adjust it to your personal preference in your editor, while respecting the rule (just pay attention to right alignments using tabs then).

All the contributed Red files to `red/red` repo should contain the following field in their header:

 Tabs: 4

Each time you go to a new line after opening a block or a parenthesis, you should indent by one tab.

*Correct*

----
 func [
     arg1
     arg2
     ...
 ][
     print arg1
     ...
 ]
----

Incorrect

---- 
 func [
 arg1				;-- missing indentation!
 arg2
 ...
 ][
		print arg1		;-- excessive indentation!
		...
 ]
----

== Block layouts 

All the following rules apply to blocks `[]` as well as parenthesis `()`.

Empty blocks do not contain any whitespace:
 
 a: []
 
Contiguous blocks do not require a whitespace between the end of one and start of another:
 
 [][]
 []()

 [
    hello
 ][						;-- no spacing required
	   world
 ]
 
However, it is acceptable to use whitespaces in-between nested blocks:

----
 array: [[] [] [] []]
 list:  [ [] [] [] [] ]

 either a = 1 [["hello"]][["world"]]
 either a = 1 [ ["hello"] ][ ["world"] ]
----

For expressions containing small blocks, they are usually opened and closed on the same line
 
 b: either a = 1 [a + 1][3]
 

If the line is too long, the block should be wrapped over several lines with one level of indentation:

*Correct*

----
 b: either a = 1 [
     a + 1
 ][
     123 + length? mold a
 ]
----

Incorrect

----
 b: either a = 1 
     [a + 1][123 + length? mold a]
----

_That style is wrong because it breaks the ability to copy/paste code to the Red console (`either` will be evaluated before the block arguments are detected)._

If the first block is small enough and can fit on the same line, then only the subsequent blocks are wrapped over several lines:

----
 print either a = 1 ["hello"][
     append mold a "this is a very long expression"
 ]

 while [not tail? series][
     print series/1
     series: next series
 ]
----

== Naming conventions 

*Variable names* should be single-word *nouns*. Choose words which are short and capturing the meaning as best as possible. Common words should be used first (_especially if they are already used in existing Red source code in the same context_). If needed, use a http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/synonym[synonyms dictionary] to find the best word for the usage. Single-letter or abbreviated words (unless the abbreviated word is in common usage) should be avoided as much as possible.

Names made of multiple words are separated with a dash `-` character. Use a two-words name only when a fitting single-word cannot be found or would be too confusing with already used ones. Variable names made of more than two words should only be used in rare cases. Using single-words as much as possible makes the code horizontally much more compact, improving readability greatly. Avoid useless verbosity.

*Correct*

----
 code: 123456
 name: "John"
 table: [2 6 8 4 3]
 lost-items: []

 unless tail? list [author: select list index]
----

Incorrect

----
 code_for_article: 123456
 Mytable: [2 6 8 4 3]
 lostItems: []

 unless tail? list-of-books [author-property: select list-of-books selected-index]
----

*Function names* should strive to be single-word _verbs_, in order to express an action, though two or three words names are often necessary. More than three words should be avoided as much as possible. Variable naming conventions also apply to function names. A noun or an adjective followed by a question mark is also accepted. Often, it denotes that the return value is of `logic!` type, but this is not a strict rule, as it is handy to form single-word action names for retrieving a property (e.g. `length?`, `index?`). When forming function names with two or more words, always put the verb in the first position. If names are picked carefully for variables and function names, the code becomes almost self-documented, often reducing the need for comments.

*Correct*

----
 make:   func [...
 reduce: func [...
 allow:  func [...
 crunch: func [...
----

Incorrect

----
 length:    func [...
 future:    func [...
 position:  func [...
 blue-fill: func [...		;-- should be fill-blue
----

There is an exception to those naming rules which applies to OS or non-Red third-party API names. In order to make API-specific function and structures field names easily recognizable, their original name should be used. It visually helps distinguish such imported names from regular Red or Red/System code. For example:

----
 tagMSG: alias struct! [
     hWnd   [handle!]
     msg    [integer!]
     wParam [integer!]
     lParam [integer!]
     time   [integer!]
     x      [integer!]
     y      [integer!]	
  ]

 #import [
    "User32.dll" stdcall [
        CreateWindowEx: "CreateWindowExW" [
            dwExStyle    [integer!]
            lpClassName  [c-string!]
            lpWindowName [c-string!]
            dwStyle      [integer!]
            x            [integer!]
            y            [integer!]
            nWidth       [integer!]
            nHeight      [integer!]
            hWndParent   [handle!]
            hMenu        [handle!]
            hInstance    [handle!]
            lpParam      [int-ptr!]
            return:      [handle!]
        ]
    ]
]
----

== Casing 

All variable and function names should be lowercase by default, unless there is a good reason for using uppercasing such as:

* name is an acronym e.g. GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)
* name is operating-system or (non-Red) third-party API-related

== Macros (Red/System) anchor:macros-redsystem[]

Apply the same naming conventions for picking up Red/System macros names. Macros generally use uppercase for names, as a way to visually distinguish them easily from the rest of the code (unless the intention is explicit to make it look like regular code, like pseudo-custom datatype definitions). When multiple words are used, they are separated by an underscore `_` character to increase even more the difference with regular code.

_(TBD: extract all single-word names used in the Red codebase as examples)_

== Function definitions 

The general rule is to keep the spec block on a single line. The body block can be on the same line or over several lines. In case of Red/System, as the spec blocks tend to be longer, most functions spec blocks are wrapped over several lines, so, for sake of visual consistency, often even small spec block are wrapped.

*Correct*

----
 do-nothing: func [][]
 increment: func [n [integer!]][n + 1]

 increment: func [n [integer!]][
    n + 1
 ]

 increment: func [
     n [integer!]
 ][
     n + 1
 ]
----

Incorrect

----
 do-nothing: func [
 ][
 ]

 do-nothing: func [

 ][

 ]

 increment: func [
     n [integer!]
 ][n + 1]
----

When the spec block is too long, it should be wrapped over several lines. When wrapping the spec block, each type definition must be on the same line as its argument. The optional attributes block should be on its own line. Each refinement starts on a new line. If followed by a single argument, the argument can be on the same line or a new line with an indentation (just be consistent with other refinements in the same spec block). For `/local` refinement, if the local words are not followed by type annotation, they can be put on the same line.

When wrapping the spec block over several lines, it is recommended to align the datatype definitions for consecutive arguments, on the same column for easier reading. Such alignment is preferably done using tabs (if you strictly follow these coding style rules) or else, using spaces.

*Correct*

----
 make-world: func [
     earth	 [word!]
     wind 	 [bitset!]
     fire	 [binary!]
     water	 [string!]
     /with
         thunder [url!]
     /only
     /into
         space   [block! none!]
     /local
	 plants animals men women computers robots
 ][
     ...
 ]
----

Incorrect

----
 make-world: func [
  	[throw] earth [word!]		;-- attributes block not on its own line
    	wind	[bitset!]
    	fire [binary!]			;-- unaligned type definition
    	water	[string!]
    	/with
            thunder [url!]
    	/only
    	/into space [block! none!]	;-- inconsistent with /with formatting
    	/local
    	    plants animals		;-- breaking line too early
    	    men women computers robots
][
	...
]
----

For docstrings, the main one (describing the function) should be on its own line if the spec block is wrapped. The argument and refinement docstrings should be on the same line as the item they are describing. Docstrings start with a capital letter and do not require an ending dot (it's added automatically when printed on screen by `help` function).

*Correct*

----
 increment: func ["Add 1 to the argument value" n][n + 1]

 make-world: func [
     "Build a new World"
     earth    [word!]      "1st element"
     wind     [bitset!]    "2nd element"
     fire     [binary!]    "3rd element"
     water    [string!]
     /with 		   "Additional element"
         thunder [url!]
     /only		   "Not implemented yet"
     /into		   "Provides a container"
         space [unset!]    "The container"
     /local
         plants animals men women computers robots
 ][
	...
 ]
----

Incorrect

----
 make-world: func ["Build a new World"	;-- should be on a newline
     earth	[word!]		"1st element"
     wind	[bitset!]	  "2nd element"	;-- excessive indentation
     fire	[binary!]
     "3rd element"			;-- should be on same line as `fire`
     water	[string!]
     /with 			"Additional element"
    		thunder [url!]
     /only "Not implemented yet"	;-- should be aligned with other docstrings
     /into
           "Provides a container"      ;-- should follow the refinement
    	    space [unset!]	"The container"
     /local
         plants animals men women computers robots
 ][
    	...
 ]
----

== Function calls 

Arguments are following the function call on the same line. If the line becomes too long, arguments can be wrapped over several lines (one argument per line) with an indentation.

*Correct*

----
 foo arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5

 process-many
     argument1
     argument2
     argument3
     argument4
     argument5
----

Incorrect

----
 foo arg1 arg2 arg3
     arg4 arg5

 foo
     arg1 arg2 arg3
     arg4 arg5

 process-many
     argument1
         argument2
             argument3
                 argument4
                     argument5
----

For long expressions with many nested parts, spotting the bounds of each expression can be sometimes difficult. Using parenthesis for grouping a nested call with its arguments is acceptable (but not mandatory).

----
 head insert (copy/part [1 2 3 4] 2) (length? mold (2 + index? find "Hello" #"o"))

 head insert 
     copy/part [1 2 3 4] 2
     length? mold (2 + index? find "Hello" #"o")
----

== Comments 

In Red codebase:

* comments are written using the `;--` prefix (stronger visual clue)
* single-line comments start at column 57 (works best on average, else column 53)
* multi-line comments are done using several single-line prefixes rather than `comment {...}` constructions.

The general rule is to put comments on the same line as the beginning of the corresponding code instead of on a new line in order to save significant vertical space. Though, if the comment is used for separating chunks of code, then putting it on a new line is fine.

== String syntax 

Use `""` for single-line strings. The `{}` form is reserved for multi-line strings. Respecting this rule ensures:

* a more consistent source representation before and after LOADing code
* better convey of meaning

One exception to the rule is when a single-line string includes the " character itself. In this case, it is preferred to use the `{}` form rather than escaping the quote `^"` as it is more readable.

== New line usage 

TBD
