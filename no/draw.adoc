== Abstract 

Draw is a dialect (DSL) of Red language that provides a simple declarative way to specify 2D drawing operations. Such operations are expressed as lists of ordered commands (using blocks of values), which can be freely constructed and changed at run-time.

Draw blocks can be rendered directly on top of an image using the `draw` function, or inside a View face using the `draw` facet (see link:view.adoc[View documentation]).

== Draw commands

Commands can either be drawing instructions or settings for the drawing instructions. When a mode is set, it will affect all subsequent operations in the current Draw session (or until changed).

Most Draw commands require coordinates to be specified. The 2D coordinate system used is:

* x axis: increasing from left to right of the display.
* y axis: increasing from top to bottom of the display.

Some drawing commands require lengths to be specified. The length required is number of pixels.

=== Line 

*Syntax*

----
line <point> <point> ...

<point> : coordinates of a point (pair!).
----

*Description*

Draws a line between two points. If more points are specified, additional lines are drawn, connecting each point in the provided order.

=== Triangle 

*Syntax*

----
triangle <point> <point> <point>

<point> : coordinates of a vertex of the triangle (pair!).
----

NOTE: A vertex is the point at which two lines meet. They are points where edges join.

*Description*

Draws a triangle with edges between the supplied vertices.

=== Box 

*Syntax*

----
box <top-left> <bottom-right>
box <top-left> <bottom-right> <corner>

=== Polygon 

*Syntax*

----
polygon <point> <point> ...

<point> : coordinates of a vertex (pair!).

<size>     : size of the bounding box (pair!).
----

*Description*

Draws an ellipse from the specified bounding box. The `size` argument represents the X and Y diameters of the ellipse.

NOTE: `ellipse` provide a more compact and box-oriented way to specify a circle/ellipse compared to `circle` command.

*Syntax*

----
arc <center> <radius> <begin> <sweep>
arc <center> <radius> <begin> <sweep> closed

<center> : coordinates of the circle's center (pair!).

*Description*

Paints an image using the provided information for position and width. If the image has no positioning information provided, then the image is painted at 0x0 coordinates. A color value can be optionally provided, it will be used for transparency. 

[NOTE]
====
* Four points mode is not yet implemented. It will allow to stretch the image using 4 arbitrary-positioned edges.
* `border` optional mode is not yet implemented.It is unlikely that this feature will be supported:
* You can't use paths to specify images. Processing paths is expensive, so it's a bad fit for the `draw` dialect that's optimized for performance. Use selective evaluation (`compose`) instead.

*Syntax*

----
 hline <end-x>   (absolute)
'hline <length>  (relative)

<end-x>  : ending position along X axis (integer! float!).
<length> : length of the line segment (integer! float!).
----

*Description*

Draws a horizontal line from the current pen position.

=== Vline

*Syntax*

----
 vline <end-y>   (absolute)
'vline <length>  (relative)

<end-y>  : ending position along Y axis (integer! float!).
<length> : length of the line segment (integer! float!).
----

*Description*

Draws a vertical line from the current pen position.

=== Line-width

Same as the Draw dialect.

=== Line-join

Same as the Draw dialect.

=== Line-cap

Same as the Draw dialect.

=== Pen

Same as the Draw dialect.

=== Fill-pen

Same as the Draw dialect.


== Default values 

When a new Draw session starts, the following default values are used:

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
|Property|   Value
|background|   `white`
|pen color|   `black`
|filling|   `off`
|anti-alias|   `on`
|font|   `none`
|line width|   `1`
|line join|   `miter`
|line cap|   `flat`
|===

== Sub blocks 

Inside Draw code, commands can be arbitrarily grouped using blocks. Semantics remain unchanged, this is currently just a syntactic sugar allowing easier group manipulations of commands (notably group extraction/insertion/removal). Empty blocks are accepted.

== Source position 

Set-words can be used in the Draw code *in-between* commands to record the current position in Draw block and be able to easily access it later.

NOTE: If the Draw block length preceeding a set-word is changed, the original position will be changed accordingly, so the set-word will not point to the same reference anymore.

== Draw function 

It is possible to render a Draw block directly to an image using the `draw` function.

*Syntax*

----
draw <size> <spec>
draw <image> <spec>

<size>  : size of a new image (pair!).
<image> : image to use as canvas (image!).
<spec>  : block of Draw commands (block!).
----

*Description*

Renders the provided Draw commands to an existing or a new image. The image value is returned by the function.

== Deprecated API

Fill-pen also supports a deprecated API which exists only for sake of compatibility with Rebol/Draw, it should not be used by new Red scripts.

*Syntax*

----
fill-pen linear <grad-offset> <grad-start-rng> <grad-stop-rng>
         <grad-angle> <grad-scale-x> <grad-scale-y> <grad-color> <offset>
         <grad-color> <offset> ...

fill-pen radial <grad-offset> <grad-focal> <grad-radius>
         <grad-angle> <grad-scale-x> <grad-scale-y> <grad-color> <offset>
         <grad-color> <offset> ...

fill-pen diamond <grad-offset> <grad-focal> <grad-radius>
         <grad-angle> <grad-scale-x> <grad-scale-y> <grad-color> <offset>
         <grad-color> <offset> ...

<grad-type>      : gradient type (word!).
<grad-offset>    : offset from where the gradient should be rendered (pair!).
<grad-start-rng> : beginning of the gradient range (integer!).
<grad-stop-rng>  : end of the gradient range (integer!).
<grad-focal>     : focal point of the gradient (pair!).
<grad-radius>    : radius of the gradient (integer!).
<grad-angle>     : (optional) rotation of the gradient in degrees (integer! float!).
<grad-scale-x>   : (optional) scale X factor (integer! float!).
<grad-scale-y>   : (optional) scale Y factor (integer! float!).
<grad-color>     : color to use for gradient filling (tuple! word!).
----

*Description*

Sets the color gradient to be used for filling operations. The following values are accepted for the type: `linear`, `radial`, `diamond`.

For example:

	fill-pen linear 0x100 0 400 red green blue box 0x100 400x300

image::../images/grad-pen.png[Grad-pen,align="center"]

NOTE: the gradient can be defined by up to 256 colors.

== Graphics source code 

The graphics in this documentation are generated using Red and Draw dialect, here is the source code (you can copy/paste it in a Red console to try/play/improve it):
