== Abstract

`Percent!` values represent link:float.adoc[float!] values expressed as percentages.

`Percent!` is a member of the following typesets: `number!`, `scalar!`


== Creation

Percent values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime by using a `make` constructor or `to` conversion.

```red
>> 100%
== 100%

>> 12.2%
== 12.2%

>> .76%
== 0.76%
```

```red
>> make percent! 1
== 100%

>> make percent! .1
== 10%

>> make percent! .01
== 1%
```

```red
>> to percent! 1
== 100%

>> to percent! .1
== 10%

>> to percent! .01
== 1%
```

== Literal syntax

```
<percent-literal> ::= <integer-literal>% | <float-literal>% 
```

== Comparisons

All comparators can be applied on `percent!`: `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, &lt;=, =?`. In addition, `min`, and `max` are also supported.


== Testing values

Use `percent?` to check if a value is of the `percent!` datatype.

```red
>> percent? 42%
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? 42%
== percent!
```
