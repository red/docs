== Abstract

`Native!` values represent external functions that are written in Red/System for the sake of performance or convenience (e.g. accessing OS APIs). Natives are used like normal function values.

`Native!` is a member of the following typesets: `any-function!`, `default!`

== Creation

Native values cannot be created at runtime.

== Conversions

No conversions are supported for `native!` values.

== Comparisons

Native values can be compared for sameness and equality with `same?`, `==`, `equal?`, `strict-equal?`, `not-equal?`, `<>`.

== Testing values

Use `native?` to check if a value is of the `native!` datatype.

```red
>> native? :do
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? :do
== native!
```

== Predefined words

Predefined `native!` values can be viewed by typing `help native!` in the Red console.
