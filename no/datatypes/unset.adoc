= Unset! datatype
:toc:
:numbered:


== Abstract

`Unset!` is a single value that represents no usable value.


== Creation

Unset values can be created at runtime using a `make` constructor or a `to` conversion.

`make unset! <any-thing>`

`to unset! <any-thing>`


== Literal syntax

There is no literal syntax for `unset!`. It is the result of evaluating `()`, `do []`, `print`, or `get/any <word>` when `<word>` has not been set.


== Testing values

Use `unset?` to check if a value is of the `unset!` datatype.

----
>> unset? 1
== false

>> unset? ()
== true

>> unset? unset 'x
== true
----

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

----
>> type? unset 'x
== unset!
----
