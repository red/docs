== Abstract

The `none!` datatype represents a value that does not belong to any other datatype. It is analogous to nil or nothing in other programming languages.

`None!` is a member of the following typesets: `immediate!`

== Creation

None values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime using a `make` constructor, or a `to` conversion.

----
>> make none! 'x
== none

>> to none! 42
== none
----

== Literal syntax

The predefined word `none` or the serialized syntax:
----
#[none]
----

== Testing values

Use `none?` to check if a value is of the `none!` datatype.

----
>> none? 1
== false

>> none? true
== false

>> none? none
== true
----

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

----
>> type? none
== none!
----
