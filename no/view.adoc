== Design goals 

The Red/View (or just View) component is a graphic system for the Red programming language. The design goals are:

* Data-oriented, minimal API
* Virtual tree of objects as programming interface
* Realtime or deferred synchronization between the virtual tree and the display system
* Make two-way binding trivial to support
* Ability to have different backends, across different platforms
* Support OS, third-party and custom widget sets
* Low performance overhead

The virtual tree is built using face objects. Each face object maps to a graphic component on the display in a two-way binding.

== Face object

Face objects are clones of `face!` template object. A field in face object is called a _facet_.

List of available facets:

[cols="1,1,1,1,2", options="header"]
|===

|Facet | Datatype | Mandatory? | Applicability | Description
|type| word!| yes| all| Type of graphic component (see link:view.html#_face_types[below]).

List of globally-usable flags for `flags` facet:

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Flag | Description
|*all-over*| Send all `over` events to the face.
|===


Other face types specific flags are documented in their respective sections.

[NOTE]
====
* Non-mandatory facets can be set to `none`.
* `offset` and `size` are specified in screen pixels.
* `offset` and `size` can sometime be set to `none` before displaying them. The View engine will take care of setting the values (like for panels in tab-panel type).
* Display order (from back to front): color, image, text, draw.
====

Creating a new face is achieved by cloning the `face!` object and providing *at least* a valid `type` name.

    button: make face! [type: 'button]

Once a face created, the `type` field is not allowed to be changed.

=== Options facet 

Options facet holds optional facets which are used for specific behaviors:

[cols="1,4" options="header"]
|===
|Option| Description
|*drag-on*| Can be one of: `'down`, `'mid-down`, `'alt-down`, `'aux-down`. Used for enabling a drag'n drop operation.
|===

* `strike`

Available anti-aliasing modes:

* active/inactive (`anti-alias?: yes/no`)
* ClearType mode (`anti-alias?: 'ClearType`)


== Para object 

Para objects are clones of `para!` template object. One para object can be referenced by one or more faces, allowing to control para properties of a group of faces from a single place.

[cols="1,1,3" options="header"]

[NOTE]
====

== The Face tree 

Faces are organized in a tree which maps to the graphic components hierarchy on the display. The tree relations are defined from:

* `pane` facet: list of one or more child face(s) in a block.
* `parent` facet: reference to parent face.

Order of face objects in a `pane` matters, it maps to the z-ordering of graphic objects (face at head of `pane` is displayed behind all other faces, the face at tail is displayed on top of all others).

The root of a face tree is a `screen` face. A `screen` face can only display `window` faces from its `pane` block.

In order for any face to be displayed on screen, it _must_ be connected to a `screen` face directly (for windows) or indirectly (for other face types).

== Face types 

=== Base 

The `base` type is the most basic face type, but also the most versatile one. By default, it will only display a background of color `128.128.128`.

|===
|Facet| Description
|`type`|	`'base`
|`image`| An `image!` value can be specified, alpha channel is supported.
|`color`| A background color can be specified, alpha channel is supported.
|`text`| An optional text to be displayed inside the face.
|`draw`| Transparency is fully supported for Draw primitives.
|===

[NOTE]
====
* Full composition of following facets is supported and rendered in following order: `color`, `image`, `text`, `draw`.
* Transparency can be achieved in `color`, `image`, `text` and `draw` by specifying an alpha channel component in color tuple values: `R.G.B.A` where `A = 0` indicates full opacity and `A = 255` full transparency.
====

_This face type should be used for any custom graphic component implementation._

== Face life cycle 

. Create a face object from the `face!` prototype.
. Insert the face object in a face tree connected to a screen face.
. Use `show` to render the face object on screen.
.. system resources are allocated at this point
.. `face/state` block is set.
. Remove the face from the pane to remove it from the display.
. The garbage collector will take care of releasing the system resources associated when the face is not referenced anymore.

[NOTE]
====
* A `free` function might be provided for manual control of system resources freeing for resources hungry applications.
====

== SHOW function 

*Syntax*
----
show <face>

<face>: clone of face! object or block of face objects or names (using word! values).
----

*Description*

This function is used to update a face or a list of faces on screen. Only a face which is referenced in a face tree connected to a screen face can be properly rendered on screen. When called the first time, system resources will be allocated, the `state` facet will be set and the graphic component will be displayed on screen. Subsequent calls will reflect on screen any change made to the face object. If `pane` facet is defined, `show` will also apply to the children faces recursively.


*State facet*

_The following information is provided only for reference, in normal operation, the `state` facet should be left untouched by the user. However, it can be accessed if OS API are called directly by user or if View engine behavior has to be modified._

[cols="1, 4", options="header"]
|===
|Position/Field| Description
|1 (handle)|	OS-specific handle for the graphic object (`integer!`).
|2 (changes)| Bit flags array marking which facet has been changed since last call to `show` (`integer!`).
|3 (deferred)| List of deferred changes since last call to `show`; when realtime updates are turned off (`block!` `none!`).
|4 (drag-offset)| Stores the starting mouse cursor offset position when entering face dragging mode (`pair!` `none!`).
|===

[NOTE]
====
* After a call to `show`, `changes` field is reset to 0 and `deferred` field block is cleared.
* A `handle!` datatype will be used in the future for opaque OS handles.
====

== Realtime vs deferred updating anchor:realtime-vs-deferred-updating[]

The View engine has two different modes for updating the display after changes are done to the face tree:

* Realtime updating: any change to a face is immediately rendered on screen.

* Deferred updating: all changes to a face are not propagated on screen, until `show` is called on the face, or on the parent face.

The switching between those modes is controlled by the `system/view/auto-sync?` word: if set to `yes`, the realtime updating mode is on (default mode), if set to `no`, View engine will defer all updates.

The motivations for realtime updating by default are:

* Simpler and shorter source code, no need to call `show` after any face change.
* Less learning overhead for beginners.
* Good enough for simple or prototype apps.
* Simplifies experimentation from console.

Deferred mode updates many changes at the same time on screen in order to avoid glitches or when best performance is the goal.

[NOTE]
====
* This is a big difference with the Rebol/View engine which only has deferred mode support.
====

== Two-way binding 

Face objects rely on the Red ownership system to bind the object with the series used in facets, so that any change in one of the facet (even a deep change) is detected by the face object and processed according to the current synchronization mode (realtime or deferred).

On the other side, changes made to the rendered graphic objects are reflected instantly in the corresponding facets. For example, typing in a `field` face will reflect the input in the `text` facet in live mode.

This two-way binding simplifies the interaction with the graphic objects for the programmer, without the need of any specific API. Modifying the facets using the series actions is enough.

Example:

----
view [
    list: text-list data ["John" "Bob" "Alice"]
    button "Add" [append list/data "Sue"]
    button "Change" [lowercase pick list/data list/selected]
]

=== Event! datatype 

An event value is an opaque object holding all the information about a given event. You access the event fields using path notation.

[cols="1, 4", options="header"]
|===
|Field| Returned value
|`type`| Event type (`word!`).
|`face`| Face object where the event occurred (`object!`).
|`window`| Window face where the event occured (`object!`).
|`offset`| Offset of mouse cursor relative to the face object when the event occurred (`pair!`). For gestures events, returns the center point coordinates.
|`key`| Key pressed (`char!` `word!`).
|`picked`| New item selected in a face (`integer!` `percent!`). For a mouse `down` event on a `text-list`, it returns the item index underneath the mouse or `none`. For `wheel` event, it returns the number of rotation steps. A positive value indicates that the wheel was rotated forward, away from the user; a negative value indicates that the wheel was rotated backward, toward the user. For `menu` event, it returns the corresponding menu ID (`word!`). For zooming gesture, it returns a percent value representing the relative increase/decrease. For other gestures, its value is system-dependent for now (Windows: `ullArguments`, field from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd353232(v=vs.85).aspx[GESTUREINFO]).
|`flags`| Returns a list of one or more flags (see list below) (`block!`).
|`away?`| Returns `true` if the mouse cursor exits the face boundaries (`logic!`). Applies only if `over` event is active. 
|`down?`| Returns `true` if the mouse left button was pressed (`logic!`).
|`mid-down?`| Returns `true` if the mouse middle button was pressed (`logic!`).
|`alt-down?`| Returns `true` if the mouse right button was pressed (`logic!`).
|`ctrl?`| Returns `true` if the CTRL key was pressed (`logic!`).
|`shift?`| Returns `true` if the SHIFT key was pressed (`logic!`).
|===

List of possible flags from `event/flags`:

* `away`
* `down`
* `mid-down`
* `alt-down`
* `aux-down`
* `control`
* `shift`

[NOTE]
====
* All fields (except `type`) are read-only. Setting `type` is only used internally by the View engine.
====

Here is the list of special keys returned as words by `event/key`:

* `page-up`
* `page-down`
* `end`
* `home`
* `left`
* `up`
* `right`
* `down`
* `insert`
* `delete`
* `F1`
* `F2`
* `F3`
* `F4`
* `F5`
* `F6`
* `F7`
* `F8`
* `F9`
* `F10`
* `F11`
* `F12`

The following extra key names can be returned by `event/key` only for `key-down` and `key-up` messages:

* `left-control`
* `right-control`
* `left-shift`
* `right-shift`
* `left-menu`
* `right-menu`


=== Actors 

Actors are handler functions for View events. They are defined in an free-form object (no prototype provided) referred by `actors` facet. All actors have the same specification block.

*Syntax*

----
on-<event>: func [face [object!] event [event!]]

<event> : any valid event name (from above table)
face    : face object which receives the event
event   : event value.
----

In addition to the GUI events, it is possible to define an `on-create` actor which will be called when the face is shown for the first time, just before system resources are allocated for it. Unlike other actors, `on-create` has only one argument, `face`.

*Return value*

----
'stop : exits the event loop.
'done : stops the event from flowing to the next face.
----

Other returned values have no effect.

=== Event flow 

Events are usually generated at a specific screen position and assigned to the closest front face. However, the event is travelling from one face to another in the ancestors hierarchy in two directions commonly known as:

* event *capturing*: event goes from window face down to the front face where the event originated. For each face, a `detect` event is generated and the corresponding handler called if provided.

* event *bubbling*: event goes from face to parent window. For each face, the local event handler is called.

image::event-flow.png[Event flow,align="center"]

Typical event flow path:

. A click event is generated on the button, global handlers are processed (see next section).
. Event capturing stage starts:
.. The window gets the event first, its `on-detect` handler gets called.
.. The panel gets the event next. Panel's `on-detect` handler gets called.
.. The button gets the event last. Button's `on-detect` gets called.
. Event bubbling stage starts:
.. The button gets the event first, its `on-click` handler gets called.
.. The panel gets the event next. Panel's `on-click` handler gets called.
.. The window gets the event last, its `on-click` handler gets called.

[NOTE]
====
* Event cancellation is achieved by returning `'done` word from any event handler.
* Event capturing is not enabled by default for performance reasons. Set `system/view/capturing?: yes` to enable it.
====

=== Global event handlers 

Before entering the event flow path, specific pre-processing can be achieved using the so-called "global event handlers". Following API is provided for adding and removing them.

==== insert-event-func

*Syntax*

----
insert-event-func <handler>

<handler> : a handler function or block of code for pre-processing event(s).

Handler's function specification: func [face [object!] event [event!]]
----    

*Return value*

----
The newly added handler function (`function!`).
----    

*Description*

Installs a global handler function, which can pre-process events before they reach the face handlers. All global handlers are called on each event, so the handler's body code needs to be optimized for speed and memory usage. If a block is provided as argument, it will be converted to a function using the `function` constructor.

The return value of the handler function:

* `none`  : the event can be processed by other handlers (`none!`).
* `'done` : other global handlers are skipped but event is propagated to child faces (`word!`).
* `'stop` : exit the event loop (`word!`).

A reference to the handler function is returned and should be saved if it needs to be removed later.

==== remove-event-func

*Syntax*

----
remove-event-func <handler>

<handler> : a previously installed event handler function.
----

*Description*

Disables a previously installed global event handler by removing it from the internal list.

== Including View component 

View component is not included by default on *compiling*. To include it, the main Red script have to declare the dependency in the header using the `Needs` field:

----
Red [
    Needs: 'View
]
----

NOTE: Using consoles auto-generated by `red` binary will include the View component on platforms where it is available, `Needs` header field is therefore not required in user scripts run from those consoles.
